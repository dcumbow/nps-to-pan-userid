- Script updated to read new XML format used in newer versions of NPS server


How to Setup:
For your NPS log files (NPS -> Accounting -> Log File Properties):
Check the boxes for Accounting Requests and Periodic Accounting Status
Uncheck the boxes for Authentication Requests and Periodic Authentication Status


Put the PS1 and XML file in a folder (C:\scripts\PANuserID, for example) on your NPS server.
Run this script as a scheduled task that starts running at 12:00:05AM daily.
Call with powershell.exe -NoExit -File "C:\scripts\PANuserID\NPS - Read File Changes to PAN.ps1" (change if needed)
Set the task to stop existing instances when a new one starts (Under Settings when setting up the task, very bottom).
Update the CHANGE ME IF NEEDED info below to match log and script locations as well as your PAN URL and API key.

#assign user to node.name
$node.name = $User
#assign ip to node.ip
$node.ip = $newIP

#save modified information back to XML template
$xml.Save($pathXml)

# CHANGE ME - PAN URL and API key
